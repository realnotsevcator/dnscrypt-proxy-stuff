## Rules for name-based query blocking, one per line
##
## Example of valid patterns:
##
## ads.*         | matches anything with an "ads." prefix
## *.example.com | matches example.com and all names within that zone such as www.example.com
## example.com   | identical to the above
## =example.com  | block example.com but not *.example.com
## *sex*         | matches any name containing that substring
## ads[0-9]*     | matches "ads" followed by one or more digits
## ads*.example* | *, ? and [] can be used anywhere, but prefixes/suffixes are faster

# Block domains by syntax
ad.*
ads.*
banner.*
banners.*
*.onion

# blocklistproject.github.io hosts
